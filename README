Objective:
Built a personal voicebot assistant that responds to introspective and biographical questions as if it were me — using natural language generation and real-time voice interaction.

Description:
This project was designed as a creative way to showcase my technical skills while allowing others (like recruiters or peers) to learn about me by simply talking 
to a bot version of me. The voicebot speaks and responds like me, based on tailored prompts and my real personal background.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (voice input/output, chat UI)

Backend: Python (FastAPI)

AI Integration: OpenAI GPT-4 API for personalized natural language responses 

Deployment: Hosted on a cloud server (HTTPS-enabled)

Data Handling: Custom prompt engineering to embed personality traits, career background, and tone

Key Highlights:

Integrated GPT model to act as a personalized assistant that “talks like me”

Used voice input and speech synthesis for an interactive conversational experience

Built end-to-end architecture (UI, API, hosting, prompt logic)

Customized GPT prompts to reflect personal tone, experiences, and values

Demonstrated API integration, server hosting, and front-to-back development
